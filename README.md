## Guidelines

The following guidelines should be taken into consideration before submitting and voting on proposals. Proposals that do not follow these guidelines might be voted down on principle.

- All proposals should first be socialized on [the Regen Network governance forum](https://commonwealth.im/regen) before being submitted on chain.

- When socializing a proposal, the initial forum post should include a rational weighing the potential pros and cons of the outcome and provide supporting documentation and examples when appropriate.

- Once a forum discussion has been created, a link to the discussion should be shared publicly in [the Regen Network Discord server](https://discord.gg/regen-network) and promoted on social media platforms including Twitter (tagging [@regen_network](https://twitter.com/regen_network)).

- The time between socializing the proposal and submitting the proposal will vary depending on the proposal and community engagement but generally a proposal should be brought to discussion at least one week before submitting the proposal on-chain.
