## Guidelines

The following guidelines should be taken into consideration before submitting and voting on proposals. Proposals that do not follow these guidelines may be voted down on principle.

- All proposals should first be socialized on the Regen Network [Governance Forum](https://commonwealth.im/regen) before they are submitted on chain (especially before the deposit is made, which will start the voting period).

- When socializing a proposal, the forum post should include a rational for the proposal that weighs the potential pros and cons of the outcome and provides supporting documentation and examples when appropriate.

- Once a forum discussion has started, a link to the discussion should be shared publicly in the #governance channel of the Regen Network [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/regen-network) and on Telegram and Twitter (tagging [@regen_network](https://twitter.com/regen_network)).

- The time between socializing the proposal and submitting the proposal will vary depending on the proposal and community engagement but generally a proposal should be brought to discussion *at least* one week before submitting the proposal on chain.

- In certain circumstances, an emergency proposal may need to be submitted. An emergency proposal fixes a security vulnerability or a critical bug in the software and in which case these guidelines may not apply.
