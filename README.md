# Regen Network Governance

This repository includes long-form proposals and supporting documentation for Regen Network governance.

It is not required that community members submit proposals to this repository or that they use this repository for long-form proposals and supporting documentation but pull requests are more than welcome. With that being said, any significant changes to the guidelines should go through the governance process in the form of a text proposal.

## Guidelines

The following guidelines should be taken into consideration before submitting and voting on proposals. Proposals that do not follow these guidelines may be voted down on principle.

- All proposals should first be socialized on the Regen Network [Governance Forum](https://commonwealth.im/regen) before they are submitted on chain (especially before the deposit is made, which will start the voting period).

- When socializing a proposal, the forum post should include a rational for the proposal that weighs the potential pros and cons of the outcome and provides supporting documentation and examples when appropriate.

- Once a forum discussion has started, a link to the discussion should be shared publicly in the #governance channel of the Regen Network [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/regen-network) and on Telegram and Twitter (tagging [@regen_network](https://twitter.com/regen_network)).

- The time between socializing the proposal and submitting the proposal will vary depending on the proposal and community engagement but generally a proposal should be brought to discussion *at least* one week before submitting the proposal on chain.

- In certain circumstances, an emergency proposal may need to be submitted. An emergency proposal fixes a security vulnerability or a critical bug in the software and in which case these guidelines may not apply.
