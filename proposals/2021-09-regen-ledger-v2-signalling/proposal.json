    "description": "This proposal is a signalling proposal for the upgrade to Regen Ledger v2.0. The results of this proposal will be interpreted as follows:\n\n- A Yes result on the proposal would provide a clear signal that the Regen Network community accepts and understands the upgrade to Regen Ledger v2.0, the decision made to pursue a permissioned ecocredit module design, and the criteria and process for becoming an allowed credit class creator.\n\n- A No result on the proposal would force reconsideration of the upgrade to Regen Ledger v2.0, the permissioned ecocredit module design, and/or the criteria and process for becoming an allowed credit class creator.\n\nMore details can be found in the long form proposal and the forum discussion:\n\n-<link>\n-<link>"
